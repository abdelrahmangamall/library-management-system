## üîê Security & Roles

### Role Hierarchy
- **ADMIN**: Full system access, user management, system configuration
- **LIBRARIAN**: Book and member management, borrowing operations, reports
- **STAFF**: Read-only access to books, basic member operations

### Authentication Flow
1. User logs in with username/password
2. System validates credentials and returns JWT token
3. Token must be included in Authorization header for protected endpoints
4. Role-based access control enforces permissions

## üìä Database Schema

### Key Entities
- **Users**: System users with role-based access
- **Members**: Library members who can borrow books
- **Books**: Core book information with metadata
- **Authors**: Author information with many-to-many book relationship
- **Categories**: Hierarchical category structure
- **Publishers**: Publisher information
- **BorrowRecords**: Borrowing transactions and history
- **UserActivities**: Audit log for user actions

### Relationships
- Books ‚Üî Authors (Many-to-Many)
- Books ‚Üî Categories (Many-to-Many)
- Books ‚Üí Publisher (Many-to-One)
- Categories ‚Üí Parent Category (Self-referencing)
- BorrowRecords ‚Üí Book, Member, User (Many-to-One)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Database Setup
1. Create MySQL database: `library_management`
2. Update `application.properties` with your database credentials
3. Application will auto-create tables on startup

### JWT Configuration
- Token expiration: 24 hours (configurable)
- Refresh token: 7 days (configurable)
- Secret key: Configurable via environment variable

### File Upload
- Book covers stored in: `${user.home}/library-management/uploads/book-covers`
- Max file size: 5MB
- Supported formats: Images only

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 17 or higher
- MySQL 8.0+
- Maven 3.6+

### Running the Application
1. Clone the repository
2. Configure database connection in `application.properties`
3. Run: `mvn spring-boot: run`
4. Application starts on port 8081

### Default Admin User
Create an admin user through direct database insertion or API:
```json
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "admin123",
  "email": "admin@library.com",
  "role": "ADMIN"
}
```

## üìã Business Rules

### Borrowing Rules
- Maximum 5 books per member
- Default borrowing period: 14 days (configurable)
- Daily fine rate: $1.00 for overdue books
- Members must be active to borrow books
- Books must be available for borrowing

### Security Rules
- Passwords encrypted with BCrypt (strength 12)
- JWT tokens required for all protected endpoints
- Role-based access control enforced
- User activities logged for audit purposes

## üîç Key Design Decisions

### Why JWT?
- Stateless authentication suitable for REST APIs
- Scalable for distributed systems
- Contains user roles for client-side decisions

### Why Role-Based Access?
- Clear separation of responsibilities
- Easy to extend with new roles
- Granular permission control

### Why Hierarchical Categories?
- Flexible organization structure
- Support for library taxonomy standards
- Easy navigation and filtering

### Why Activity Logging?
- Audit trail for compliance
- User behavior analysis
- Security monitoring

## üß™ Testing

The API can be tested using:
- Postman collections (included)
- Unit tests with MockMvc
- Integration tests with TestContainers

## üìà Performance Considerations

- Database indexes on frequently queried fields
- Pagination for large datasets
- Lazy loading for entity relationships
- Connection pooling with HikariCP
- Caching with Caffeine

## üîí Security Features

- Password encryption (BCrypt)
- JWT token validation
- CORS configuration
- Input validation
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection headers

## üìù Future Enhancements

- Email notifications for overdue books
- Book reservation system
- Digital book support
- Advanced reporting dashboard
- Mobile app integration
- Barcode scanning support
